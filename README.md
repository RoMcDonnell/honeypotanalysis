### Description

<p>
This application was created to analyse the log files of a honeypot. It gives 2 windows. The first window is to login and the second window is a menu window. <br>
The menu window offers 4 different options: <br>
1. Top 10 IP addresses <br>
2. Attack summary FAIL/SUCCESS <br>
3. Monthly Attack Summary <br>
4. 24 hour analysis <br>
<br>
The technologies I used were:<br>
1. Linux Mint OS - for security and due it being lightweight<br>
2. Eclipse - I used Eclipse to create my Java application which would call a shell script<br>
3. Shell Terminal - I used this to create 4 short scripts which would pull data from the honeypot log files<br>
<br>
Challenges face include:<br>
1. Installing the Linux Mint Server
2. Getting a java script to call a shell script into Eclipes
3. Creating the JFrame
4. Getting everything up onto GitHub
